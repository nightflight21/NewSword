1) Adding a feature
    a) Create any new actor classes that are needed, e.g. Hero
    b) Create any new action classes that use those actors
        i) e.g. SteerHeroAction, MoveHeroAction, CollideHeroAction, DrawHeroAction
        ii) Note, create granular drawing actions like DrawHeroAction but make sure
            that you actually execute it in the more generic DrawActorsAction class.
    c) Instantiate the new actors and actions in Program.cs
